I know you've been waiting eagerly, but it's finally here: my own personal blog! ... Just kidding, I can hear the crickets chirping. This is intended to be an informal space for me to write about topics of interest. Mostly technical posts about what I'm learning in "cyber" security (to use the current vernacular). Perhaps other topics as well. If future generations come across these posts and benefit, that will be great!
